            description: ` In a powerful display of solidarity, The BMA Administration, Faculty, Staff and the Corps of Midshipmen of the Academy gathered at BMA Grounds today, March 11 2024, to show their unwavering support to the movement of Philippine Association of Maritime Institution (PAMI).
Alongside the morning parade of the BMA Corps of Midshipmen was the parade of the BMA Administration, Faculty and Staff to show our commitment and this would serve as a silent protest against this provision of the bill that would eventually become a death sentence to the future of the new generation of seafarers.
This movement of the institution highly supports the opposition against the Magna Carta for Filipino Seafarers specifically Chapter 18 as it poses threats to our Maritime Education Sector.
In line with this, We shall continually wear a BLACK POLO or TSHIRT to signify and present our stand against this threat that would jeopardize the future of the maritime industry in terms of supply of manpower.
